Idea for final project:

Liberty Mutual has begun to offer "By-Mile" insurance (insurance that comes with a short up-front fee and then you a small amount per mile driven per month). My project would center around creating a web application that integrates into the Google Maps API to calculate an estimated by trip cost for a given drive under a by-mile program. Ideally a customer would quote under the By-Mile program resulting in their By-Mile rate, then be brought to my application to put in a few routes and better understand their costs. Users would input a starting and ending destination (we would suggest they start with their commutes, and maybe even allow them to say how many days a week they commute, to get an estimated annual cost). 

Technologies used: Google Maps API, JDBC, Java Spring and some theoretical rates for by-mile.
